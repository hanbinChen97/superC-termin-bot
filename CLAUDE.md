# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an automated appointment checking bot for the Aachen AuslÃ¤nderamt (immigration office). The bot monitors appointment availability at two locations (SuperC and Infostelle) and automatically books the first available slot when one becomes available.

## Core Architecture

### Main Components

- **superc.py / infostelle.py**: Location-specific entry points that run continuous monitoring loops
- **appointment_checker.py**: Core appointment checking logic that orchestrates the entire flow
- **form_filler.py**: Handles final form submission with personal data and CAPTCHA recognition
- **utils.py**: Utility functions for page content saving and CAPTCHA image downloading
- **llmCall.py**: Azure OpenAI integration for CAPTCHA text recognition
- **config.py**: Configuration constants including locations, URLs, and file paths
- **db/models.py**: Defines database models for users and appointment profiles
- **db/utils.py**: Database utility functions for querying and updating appointment profiles

### Flow Architecture

The appointment booking follows a 6-step process:
1. Get initial page (Schritt 1-2)
2. Select location type (SuperC/Infostelle)
3. Get location info (Schritt 3)
4. Submit location and check availability (Schritt 4)
5. Select first available appointment (Schritt 5)
6. Fill form with personal data and submit (Schritt 6)

### Personal Data Management

- Personal information is stored in files named `table` or `hanbin` (deprecated, use database instead now)
- The system dynamically selects which file to use based on appointment date (before September uses `hanbin`, September+ uses `table`)
- Database integration is now the primary method for managing user profiles and appointment statuses

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Bot
```bash
# For SuperC location monitoring
nohup python3 superc.py 2>&1 | tee superc.log

# For Infostelle location monitoring  
python3 infostelle.py

# Background process
source .venv/bin/activate && nohup python app.py > app.log 2>&1 &
```

### Key Dependencies
- requests>=2.31.0 - HTTP requests and web scraping
- beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0 - HTML parsing
- python-dotenv==1.0.0 - Environment variables
- openai>=1.0.0 - CAPTCHA recognition via Azure OpenAI API
- sqlalchemy>=2.0.0 - Database ORM
- psycopg2-binary>=2.9.0 - PostgreSQL adapter

## File Structure Notes

- `pages/` - Directory for saved HTML content during debugging
- `logs/` - Application logs and saved HTML responses
- `table` / `hanbin` - Personal information files (JSON format)
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies (note: contains Unicode BOM characters)
- `db/` - Database models and utility functions

## Important Configuration

- Base URL: `https://termine.staedteregion-aachen.de/auslaenderamt/`
- Locations are configured in `config.py` with specific selection and submit text
- User agent is configured to mimic Chrome browser
- The bot saves page content at each step for debugging purposes

## Monitoring and Logs

The application uses Python's logging module with timestamps and runs in continuous loops with 60-second intervals between checks. Each location runs independently and exits when an appointment is successfully booked.
